# iris_sub_specie_detection_ai
This iOS app takes length and width of iris flower using AR tech and then uses a prediction via trained ml model in the backend and displays the sub specie of Iris


This is a full tutorial on how I created this iOS app. It has the following phases:-
1. train a model on famous Iris Dataset
2. Deploy the model ( I have used AWS windows server )
3. Create API for that trained model ( used Django for this )
4. create the iOS app. ( I will not discuss the basics of iOS app dev. here but discuss the important codes in detail )

<u>Starting from phase 1.</u>
 
#Train the AI model on Iris Dataset

you can download the Iris Dataset from the link below :-
